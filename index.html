      <p>Happy Holidays!, Ma'am Roan</p>
      <p>I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for us in our ITWSO2 class. I was worried at first since you sounded strict and serious. I was worried in your classes since I talk too much and worried that you'll scold me. But as the weeks passed, I realized how much you helped and guided us.</p>
      <p>Your suggestions and instructions were very helpful, and I appreciate everything you taught us. I'll never forget when I presented my case study to you. After you made your comments, you told me I looked exhausted and should take a break.That was the first time a professor told me that in college, and it made me feel much better. I was sick with a fever at the time, and your words encouraged and motivated me.
      I promise we will do our best to respect your rules and not disrupt the class. We realize the importance of a positive learning environment, and we appreciate your patience and loved na binigay niyo po samin</p>
      <p> We love you ma'am see u around and also baka mag NST ako sa 3rd year baka hindi na po kita maging prof pero magkikita pa rin tayo ma'am and also apaka saya ko po nung nalaman ko po yung grades ko hindi po ako naghahangad ang mataas ang tanging hiling ko lang po ay makapasa, thank u ma'am sana po magpahinga po kayo minsan kapag napapagod po kayo and always pray po, happy hollidays ma'am and also to sir alex ingat po kayo</p>
